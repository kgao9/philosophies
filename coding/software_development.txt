So here's what I'm doing now. I started at Morgridge Institute of Research in November, and I saw my boss
creating software specifications. So what I do now for all my software endeavors is I create software_requirements.txt for
my software packages/projects and specification docstrings for all my python functions. It's a new thing I'm trying out.

In the past few weeks, I've also switched my git model slightly. At SSEC, I was using this model:
User requests feature -> create feature branch -> complete and test feature -> merge to develop -> test develop -> merge to master
-> repeat. The new model is do the same thing for features, but instead of merging to master, merge into tests and then merge into 
master after a few merges. 

This is because of Morgridge's custom made pipeline. To recreate calculations, it uses hashes created with GUP version number. If we update
too often, software development slows down because the previous calculations can't be found - hence we need to rerun the calculations. This
new git model causes fewer updates to master, so the gup version doesn't need to change as frequently.
