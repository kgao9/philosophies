Bacon once asked me, why do we take such hard courses?

This is the answer I gave him. We take hard classes in order to challenge ourselves.
The only way for us to grow as humans and as computer scientists is when
we challenge ourselves to be better, to think better, and to be more aware
of everything that we do not know. Humans get complacent: they resist change, but only through
change do we actually become better, more compassionate and knowledgable.

For me personally, every time I take a challenging course, I need to spend weeks recovering -
otherwise, I'd proably go insane. But I like doing it because you get to think about stuff
that you've never thought about before - and so you learn a new way of thinking about the world.
Of course, too much of that isn't good for a fragile mind, so I don't recommend it unless
you can handle stress and pressure extremely well.
